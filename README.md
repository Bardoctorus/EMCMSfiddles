# This isn't for you go away

ok that's rude, but this is such a specific use case that this README is for me.

There's an offline "danger" file needed for this to run.

In the program directory you need a folder called danger.

In that folder you need an \_\_init\_\_.py and a danger.py

in danger.py you need:

username = YOURUSERNAME
password = YOURPASSWORD

that shit stays offline always lol you are totally gonna forget that and fuck this up YEP
